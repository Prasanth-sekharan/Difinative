# How to create Agent in FreshService
You can add all your technicians and managers as technicians to your service desk by clicking on the Agents icon under the Admin tab.

When you add a new agent, their role will determine the kind of access* they'll have in the service desk. If multiple roles are set for an agent, the higher level of access will apply. At the maximum restriction, you can choose to only allow agents to view tickets that have been assigned to them, or at the minimum, give them complete access to your help desk including the setup and configurations under the Admin tab.

### A quick guide to adding agents to Freshservice:

3. Click on the New Agent button on the top.
4. Specify if you want the agent to be full-time or occasional.
5. Type in basic information about the agent, including name and email address.
6. Add the agent to relevant groups.
7. You can optionally add a profile picture and describe what the agent will be doing in the organization.
8. In case you have enabled the gamification settings in Freshservice Arcade, you can let your experienced agents start with more points.
9. Choose a role for the agent by clicking on the Associate Role button.
10. Click on Save.


The agent will now receive an activation email in his mailbox which will help him in setting up a password and activating his account in your service desk.

## View Agent Profile

Once you're done adding agents to your service desk, you can view their profile. This will contain details about the agent such as their email addresses, groups they belong to, badges they've received as a part of the arcade, etc. You can also view the tickets requested by them and the tickets and assets that have been assigned to them.
